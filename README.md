A text classification dataset is provided (named “bbc_news”). The dataset contains news articles split into five categories: tech, business, sport, politics and entertainment. Based on this dataset, we are asked to preprocess the data, select features and train and evaluate a machine learning model of their choice for classifying news articles. We should include at least three different features to train their model, one of them should be based on some sort of word frequency. We can decide the type of frequency (absolute or relative, normalized or not) and text preprocessing for this mandatory word frequency feature. The remaining two (or more) features can be chosen freely. Then, we are asked to perform feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of all features. Note: Training, development and test sets are not provided. It is up to the individual to decide the evaluation protocol and partition (e.g., cross-validation or pre-defining a training, development and test set). Deliverables for this part are the Python code including all steps. 

The dataset , Python code and REDME file is available. 
1)Downlaod the the BBC file it consists of 2225 documents and keep the file in Downloads in the system.
2)Now in the code ,where we are defining the dataset 'data_class_path = "C:/Users/c23084426/Downloads/bbc' ,change is required as per the actual path, after downloading the BBC file.
3)After changing the datapath, please run the code.
